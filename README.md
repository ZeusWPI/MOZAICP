# MOZAICP (silent P)

MOZAIC is the **M**assive **O**nline **Z**eus **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence **C**ompetition **P**latform.
It aims to provide a flexible platform to host your very own AI competition. Just plug your game, and off you go!

Eventually MOZAIC should be very modular, so that you can provide a custom-tailored experience for your competitors, without having to worry about the heavy lifting.
